# Traffic Light System
## Using an Ultrasonic Sensor
I used an ultrasonic sensor to create an if-else statement to carry out actions when it senses the presence of pedestrians. If there are no pedestrians, the car green light and the pedestrian red light will be on. However, if the pedestrians are at 5cm or less distance to the sensor, the car red light and the pedestrian green light will be on for five seconds. The blinking of the pedestrian green light at the end of the 5 seconds is to give alert to the pedestrians that their time has ended.
